**NOTE - THE MODDERS' RESOURCE IS _NOT_ A MOD HOSTING SITE. WE SUGGEST YOU UPLOAD MODS THAT ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR THIS CONTENT TO [THE SONIC 3 A.I.R. GAMEBANANA GAME PAGE](https://gamebanana.com/games/6878) INSTEAD.**

# Terms/Glossary
This is a short list of terms that will be referred in this Wiki page. Term names are identified in bolding.

**Mods** are shorthand for modifications and are used to describe any file that modifies the base game Sonic 3 A.I.R. **Modding** is the creation and usage of mods.

**Modders** are described commonly as a group of people who create mods and participate in modding.

**The Modders' Resource** will be described as the GitHub repository <https://github.com/Sonic-3-AIR-Modders-Board/3AIR-Mod-Resources> (this is the repository you are browsing right now.) It is currently maintained by the Modder's Board, a collective head of Sonic 3 A.I.R. modding.

An **asset** will be described as a file that have value in the modding of Sonic 3 A.I.R., such as scripts, sprites, audio, mods, etc..

**Contributing** is described as giving assets to this public repository. The word 'giving' is used here because you are willingly giving your assets to the Modders' Resource with the clear goal in mind that it will be used in worthwhile ways (such as being beginner content, or to hasten mod development.)

# Why Contribute?
The Modders' Resource's main mission is to achieve three goals:
1. To help in assisting with a beginner friendly modding environment.
2. To make modding more assessable and easier for all skill levels.
3. To provide valuable resources to mod developers.

By contributing to our ever-growing public GitHub repository, you help to achieve our mission that was set out.

# Your Asset Rights
When you contribute your asset to the Modders' Resource, you agree to co-own the asset with the Modders' Resource. You and your asset are granted all rights defined in this section. If you do not agree to the rights as shown below, _do not contribute your asset to the Modders' Resource_.

> If you have any further questions about contributing or your asset rights, do feel free to ask in the [Sonic 3 A.I.R. Discord server](https://dc.railgun.works/s3air).

## Usage
You agree that contributing ensures your asset are now public for anyone to use, essentially public domain. For more specific details, the following are guaranteed:
* That it is free to use for any purpose non-commercially.
* Credit and permission to use said assets will not be required.
* The asset will become fully editable.

## Editing and Updating
Your asset may be edited and updated by anyone on the Modders' Resource for a number of reasons (such as defining more appropriate variable names, fixing a crash that occurs on a new preview version, small sprite fixes, etc.) However you retain full co-ownership of the asset. This includes retaining all rights in this page.

## Removal
You have the right to remove your assets from the Modders' Resource at any point, for any reason. When removing your asset, co-ownership is revoked and you are left with full, 100% ownership of said asset.

Assets may also be removed at the discretion of 3 or more contributors *and* the GitHub repository manager. Again, you receive full ownership if this scenario occurs.

Keep in mind that any mod made before the date of removal are guaranteed the right to use the asset regardless of its availability on the repository. This also applies to updates of said mods. However, any future mod created with a removed asset is not guaranteed rights by the Modders' Resource.

If you had your asset removed, you may ask for your removed asset to be added back in at any point in the future by normal means of contributing.

## Partial Ownership
This section is only applied when you are contributing an asset that has been created by other people or one you do not fully own. Some examples that would be applied include sprite sheets made by multiple people, a mod featuring example audio from another modder, or a script you are submitting on behalf of them. _Reminder these are examples, the assets themselves are dealt on a case by case basis._

When you contribute a asset you do not own or fully own, you must submit proof that anyone who owns/co-own it agrees to their rights to this asset being submitted. The proof must be fully provable in some way due to how easy it can be to create fake proof with modern tools and software (or Ctrl + Shift + I.) The owner could also check in with a GitHub contributor and state that they would be fine with their asset being uploaded.

Keep in mind that if you are submitting on behalf of someone and do not own the asset in any way, you do not gain co-ownership rights over it. The rights go to the original owner(s) instead.

Additionally, it is important to note that all owners of said asset can remove it from the repository at any point without needing approval of any other owner.

# Asset Cleanliness Guidelines
To make sure every asset is clean and easily accessible for everyone, we have strict guidelines in place to make sure they are created and contributed with care. Read about the guidelines of the asset you want to contribute as well as the General contribution guidelines. Make sure your asset follows the guidelines and display a level of quality.

If you do not follow them, you may either be rejected and provided a recommendation, or have your asset edited to better suit the guidelines (though we will never add your edited asset without your permission first.)

There are asset template files required for usage on a few select categories, as they contain essential parts (like author notes in the scripts category.)

## General
Assets are for everyone and should be treated as such. This means that assets found in the Modders' Resource should not be offensive in any manner (such as promoting controversial causes.) Additionally, NSFW and personalized assets are not allowed.

Personalized assets are a somewhat subjective area, however it generally refers to assets which appeal to only to a small group of individuals. So for example, a custom OC sprite sheet is considered personalized. However, a sprite sheet of Sonic isn't.

All assets should also present overall grammatically correct spelling. It doesn't have to be perfect though when you submit, mistakes can be made and will get caught and fixed.

## Articles
Articles are files that are published for reading within the repository. Such examples includes tutorials, documents, documentation, guides, etc..

Acceptable file formats are currently `.md`, `.pdf`, and `.txt`.

The following subfolders within the repository are available to submit articles to:
* articles/
* documentation/
* guides/
* tutorials/

### Language and Grammar
Articles should use proper grammar, punctuation, and clear language to make them easy to understand and read. For example, using correct capitalization and using periods to separate sentences.

Articles may be published in languages other than English (such as Spanish) however they should be published within another subfolder. Using Google Translate or other translation software to translate an article into another language is not acceptable.

### Markup
Any type choices (such as **bold**, or _italics_.) should be used carefully to convey messages and make the text clearer. Do not overuse them as it makes the text more messier and try not to use them for unrelavant information.

Images may be used to provide extra clarification. However, do not make it the main information. Your text should be readable without images.

Links may be used as well, however they should link to trustworthy sites. Additionally, you should not use language which would not make sense on paper (such as, "click here to download," "scroll down".)

### Other Guidelines
Assets/mods may be used in your article, however permission must be granted to do so. This does not apply to assets/mods that are made to be used freely (such as using the Assets folder in the Data Select Character Sprites mod by Vinegar/Veenee) or if you are using assets from the Modders' Resource.

## Scripts
Script assets are any file with the file extension `.lemon`. They should be created using the [template script file](https://github.com/Sonic-3-AIR-Modders-Board/3AIR-Mod-Resources/blob/main/contribution_templates/script.lemon) which includes the disclaimer and author notes.

### Code Guidelines
Because script files uploaded to the Modders' Resource can be viewed and used by everyone, they should be readable to anyone. That's why there are code guidelines in place for script files so that all script files uploaded to the repository are uniform and understandable.

#### Commenting/Documentation
Make sure the script is documented and commentated to the best of your ability.

All comments should have a space between the // and your text as shown here in this example:
```
function void exampleFunction()
{
	// This comment is correct.

	//This one is missing a spacing.

	//     This one has too many spaces.
}
```
Additionally, comment blocks should be formatted to have their inside comment be exactly one tab indent as shown here in this example:
```
function void exampleFunction()
{
	/*
		This comment is correct.
	*/

	/*
This one is too short behind.
	*/

	/*
				This one is too far ahead.
	*/
}
```
The disclaimer and the author notes comment blocks should be located at the top of your script as shown in the template script file. The author notes should be filled with details about the script itself or a description about it. The Author Notes are only required in main.lemon in scenarios where multiple script files are used, but may be used elsewhere as well if needed.

Here's a example of a proper disclaimer and author note segment made for a script that reverses Sonic's Fire Shield ability and makes him fly backwards instead of where the player is facing:
```
/*

	This script file is part of the Sonic 3 A.I.R. Modders Resource. The Modders
	Resource is a free resource library for any 3 A.I.R. modder, and for any
	non-commercial purpose. No permission to use needed, no crediting required!

	Come check it out at https://github.com/Sonic-3-AIR-Modders-Board/3AIR-Mod-Resources!

*/

// Author Notes
/*

	This script file makes Sonic's Fire Shield
	ability launch him backwards.

	In SonicPressedJumpInMidAir(), simply by changing
	char.velocity.x = vx
	to
	char.velocity.x = -vx
	we can make Sonic dash backwards instead.

*/
```
#### Syntax and Cleanliness
Make sure to indent properly with the Tab key. It's more convenient for all involved, and mixing tab spacing and space bar spacing can cause the script to become disjointed and messy. Using the example below, copy and paste it into different script/text editors (such as Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc.) and see why mixing different spacing techniques is unreadable.
```
function bool thisSpacingIsBad()
{
	u8 character = getMainCharacter()

    if (global.characters == CHARS_SONIC_AND_TAILS || global.characters == CHARS_SONIC_ALONE)
		return true
	else if (global.characters == CHARS_TAILS_ALONE)
        return false
	else
		return false

	return true
}
```
Variable and custom function names should be descriptive about itself. Additionally, they should follow Camel Casing as shown in the example:
```
function void Test.testTesting()
{
	// Proper Camel Casing of a varible and function looks like this.
	sonicPosition.X = 104
	Menu.shouldUseOptions = true

	sonicPosition.Y = returnSonicYPos()

	// This is how they look without being descriptive or using Camel Casing.
	sonicpositionx = 104
	menuvar = true

	ypos = testFunction()

	/*
		See how unneeded these new names are?
	*/
}
```
Condition checks (such as if conditions) should be properly formatted with circle brackets `()`. The example below illustrates various if conditions:
```
function string exampleFunction()
{
	u8 test = 1
	bool testBoolean = true

	if (test == 2)
	{
		return "This functon is correct."
	}
	else if (testBoolean && test == 1)
	{
		return "So is this one."
	}
	else if ((!testBoolean) || (test == 3))
	{
		return "A bit harder to read, but also correct."
	}

	if test == 6
	{
		return "This one is missing circle brackets."
	}
	else if testBoolean && test == 0
	{
		return "So is this one."
	}
	else if (!testBoolean) && (test == 3)
	{
		return "Surprisingly, this one is correct. While they're not wrapped, this is perfectly fine as well."
	}
}
```
Constant/Define/Global variables and script file inclusions should be defined after the Author Notes section and before any functions like shown in this example below:
```
/*

	Imagine these are author notes. Refer back
	to the earlier author notes section for
	more information about this.

*/

constant u8 grandpasCookies = 0x03
define u8 grandmasCookies = 0x04
global u16 ovenTemperature

include oven
include bathroom/sink
include bedroom/?
```
_Note that variables and inclusions do not have to be in order._

You should define the variables in the main.lemon where applicable. However, in cases where that variable is only used in one file, it is fine to define variables in different script files as long as it is, again, before any functions.

#### Other Guidelines
Remember to optimize the script to the best of your ability, such as removing unnecessary code and providing better mod support.

Additionally, the script should not bring up a error on the latest stable/preview/test version available for Sonic 3 A.I.R..

## Sprite Sheet/File
Sprite sheets are files that contain sprites or other artwork in them and have either the `.png` or `.bmp` file extension. They may also come with a .json file that defines the sprites within the sheet itself.

Currently, other file types are not accepted (such as `.gif`) and your sprite should be converted to such a format.

If you include a .json file with your sprite, it should be located in the same folder with the same file name. Additionally, if your sprite uses custom palettes it's corresponding .png palette file should be located in a palettes/ folder within the same directory, and again, with the same name. Here's a example of how both would look with a file called `sprite.bmp`:
```
palettes/sprite.png
sprite.bmp
sprite.json
```
The sheet should not be a light edit of a sprite (such as removing parts of a sprite.) However, in the case of templates (like a empty monitor frame/life icon) this is acceptable.

Templates for characters should be easily usable for a wide arrange of sprite sizes. Of course it doesn't have to be a huge amount of space, but it shouldn't exactly be not enough space for slightly larger sprites.

## Audio
Currently, the Modders' Resource is not accepting audio files by themselves. Rather, they should be part of a mod.

Audio that is considered music should be properly looped unless otherwise noted (such as in cases where the music cannot loop in a way that is natural sounding.

Audio that can be considered ear-screeching or obnoxious is not accepted; as it may offend listeners of said audio.

## Rawdata
Rawdata assets are pairs of files, being both the rawdata itself (the .bin file) and the defining of that rawdata (the .json file.)

Rawdata assets are quite unique in the fact that they aren't quite as editable as other files. As such, they are handled on a case-by-case basis. To make sure your rawdata asset is usable for the Modders' Resource, consider if your asset could be used in varying ways or if its generally useful for a specific task that may come up in modding (such as making Sonic 1 accurate character animations without scripts.)

## Mods
In the event your asset requires multiple different kinds of files (such as using a script and a sprite, or rawdata and a audio for example) you have the option of uploading as a mod folder instead of as separate files. While it's acceptable as a mod, do consider if your content could be uploaded not as one big mod folder but rather as multiple different files, if so we recommend you do that instead.

Mods are uploaded in the mods/ folder of the repository, which currently does not have any subfolders.

### Mod.json
As of current, there are two different Mod.json template files that are required for mods:
1. [No Settings Template](https://github.com/Sonic-3-AIR-Modders-Board/3AIR-Mod-Resources/blob/main/contribution_templates/no_settings_mod.json)
2. [With Settings Template](https://github.com/Sonic-3-AIR-Modders-Board/3AIR-Mod-Resources/blob/main/contribution_templates/settings_mod.json)

Using the Settings template file, the settings themselves should modify the mod in some capacity. Additionally, their category, internal, and display names should be descriptive as well to what they are.

The Name section should be a descriptive or accurate name of the mod in question (for example, a wall-jump ability mod could be titled "Wall Jump for Sonic".) and the Author section should list the creator(s) of said mod and its contents. The Description and URL sections should be left alone and remain unmodified as they are.

### Other Guidelines
The mod should contain all the files that are needed. Unnecessary files should be eliminated where applicable (such as unused content, leftover script files, etc.)

The mod should be viewable within the latest stable/preview/test release of Sonic 3 A.I.R., and when enabled by itself it should not crash or otherwise display a error.

# Ready to Contribute?
If your asset is finished and ready for the public, than we can begin with submitting a fork and pull requesting.

> If you do not wish to create a pull request, get in contact with the repository manager via Discord @ _AirWay1#7049_.

## Forking and Pull Requesting
To begin, [create a fork of the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and submit files in there.

Afterwards, submit a pull request using the Pull Request Template and fill out all required fields of information.

## Rejection
If your asset was rejected, this was probably due to the Contributor Guidelines not being followed. Here are some common examples:
- Assets does not meet style or are low quality.
- Assets are personalized.
- Assets are not yours.

Recommendations will be provided and you are encouraged to try again. If you think we made a mistake, do let us know!
