The Modders' Resource is a free, non-commercial resource created by modders _for_ modders. Every asset available in this public repository can be used for any purpose non-commercially, and without the need of crediting or asking for permission.

### Usage Guidelines
As stated, the assets are free for open usage with the only exemption being commercial usage.

Commercial usage occurs when the usage of assets are for profit in real world currency or any digital item/currency that can be turned into real world currency. This includes paid-access, paywalled, or commisioned content (for example, as a Patreon reward for paid tiers.)

An example of non-commercial, commisioned usage would be Gamebanana points from requests. The only thing you could really turn them into is games.

### More Information

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/AirWay1/3AIR-Mod-Resources/wiki) for more information on the Modders' Resource, including contributor information and a FAQ that should hopefully answer any questions you may have.
